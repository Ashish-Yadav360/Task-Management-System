Hi Team,

Created API endpoints using the mongo db database ip address is not specifically configured,
if you will clone this repo and try to hit the api endpoints from your system it will work as expected. 
I have used mongodb atlas uri and created clusture and collections online for your better experience. 

Addtionally i have also implemented the user authentication end points as well for just my better practice. 
Pls ignore if not required. 

Thanks for the Opportunity.
